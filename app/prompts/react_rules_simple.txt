**CRITICAL RULES:**
1.  **JSON ONLY:** Output ONLY the JSON object.
2.  **ACTION/ANSWER EXCLUSIVE:** If `action` is NOT `null`, `answer` MUST be `null`. If `answer` is NOT `null`, `action` MUST be `null`.
3.  **USE TOOLS FROM LIST:** If you decide to use a tool, the `action` value MUST use a tool name *exactly* from the `Available Tools` list. Mention the chosen tool name in your `thought`.
4.  **DIRECT ANSWER:** If you can answer directly without tools, set `action` to `null` and provide the full answer in `answer`.
5.  **ANSWER FROM OBSERVATION:** If you used a tool and received an Observation, use the *content* of the Observation to formulate your final `answer` in the *next* step (setting `action` to `null`). Do not just say 'The result is shown above'. Include the actual result in the `answer` field.
